Based in Indianapolis.","I'm **Bo Cooper**, a senior front‑end engineer specializing in **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**. I help teams design and build fast, accessible products with clean UI architecture and developer‑friendly design systems.\n\n### What I do\n- Design system foundations (tokens, primitives, slots‑first APIs)\n- Nuxt 3 migrations and performance tuning (bundle budgets, caching, SSR)\n- Accessible UI patterns and testing (axe, keyboard flows, semantics)\n- DX improvements (storybook/docs, linting, CI previews, release hygiene)\n\n### How I work\nI like short feedback loops and clear constraints. I collaborate closely with design and product, ship iteratively, and measure impact with real metrics (Core Web Vitals, activation, retention).\n\n### Outside of code\nI enjoy cycling, great coffee, and contributing to open source when I can.\n\nWant to see examples?
