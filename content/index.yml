    - title: Services & Process
      questions:
        - label: What services do you offer?
          content: |
            I focus on front‑end engineering with Vue/Nuxt: UI architecture, design systems, performance audits, accessibility, and developer experience improvements. I also collaborate on UX to ensure what we ship is truly usable.
        - label: What is your process like?
          content: |
            Discover → scope → design system + IA → component primitives → pages → polish (perf/a11y) → instrumentation. I work in short feedback loops with design and product.
        - label: Do you work with startups?
          content: |
            Absolutely! I enjoy working with startups to help shape their product vision and create user-friendly interfaces from the ground up. I can adapt my process to fit the fast-paced startup environment.
    - title: Pricing & Timelines
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            It depends on scope. Typical engagements start around $5k for focused audits or component work. Larger design‑system or migration projects range higher. I’ll provide a clear estimate after discovery.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin work, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and Stripe.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and complexity. Smaller projects might take 3-4 weeks, while larger, more involved projects can range from 2 to 4 months. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.
        - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
          content: |
            Yes, for clients needing ongoing design support, feature development, or maintenance, I offer monthly retainer options tailored to specific needs. Let's discuss if this is something you're interested in.
    - title: About Me
      questions:
        - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
          content: |
            Solving real user problems and empowering teams. I enjoy the mix of systems thinking, performance tuning, and building small details that make interfaces feel effortless.
        - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
          content: |
            Outside of code I like cycling, coffee, and occasionally contributing to open source.
