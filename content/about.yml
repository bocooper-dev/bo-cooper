title: About Me
description: Senior Vue.js/Nuxt.js engineer focused on performance, accessibility, and design systems. Based in Indianapolis.
content: |
  I'm **Bo Cooper**, a senior front‑end engineer specializing in **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**. I help teams design and build fast, accessible products with clean UI architecture and developer‑friendly design systems.

  ### What I do
  - Design system foundations (tokens, primitives, slots‑first APIs)
  - Nuxt 3 migrations and performance tuning (bundle budgets, caching, SSR)
  - Accessible UI patterns and testing (axe, keyboard flows, semantics)
  - DX improvements (storybook/docs, linting, CI previews, release hygiene)

  ### How I work
  I like short feedback loops and clear constraints. I collaborate closely with design and product, ship iteratively, and measure impact with real metrics (Core Web Vitals, activation, retention).

  ### Outside of code
  I enjoy cycling, great coffee, and contributing to open source when I can.
