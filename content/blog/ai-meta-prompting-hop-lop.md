Most prompt chains collapse because context is unstructured. Separating meta instructions (HOP) from tactical directives (LOP) creates durable, debuggable flows.

## Model
- HOP: Governing constraints & roles (non-ephemeral)
- LOP: Task-specific payload (ephemeral)

## Template Example
```txt
[HOP]
Role: Senior Vue/Nuxt Engineer AI
Goals: Generate concise component scaffolds
Constraints: No unused imports, accessible markup, type-safe
Quality Gates: lint clean, no console warnings

[LOP]
Task: Build a composable for network status with online/offline events and throttled state updates.
```

## Code Doc Generator Mini-Case
A doc generator can parse components â†’ emit prop/event tables. HOP defines tone + format; each file run is a LOP.

## Benefits
- Repeatability
- Easier diffing & debugging
- Clear separation of stable vs volatile input

## Wrap Up
Think of HOP as the contract and LOP as the request. Explicit boundaries reduce prompt drift and improve output consistency.
